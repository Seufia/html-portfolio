<h1>Is it Poetry?</h1>
<p>She sees everyone but nobody notices her. In the aple of your eye I met Loneliness.</p>

<p>I discover colors, I follow movements, I capture joys and I see love. Scents create memories. 
  I have a panoply of flavors and textures that pass through my lips and I keep it on my tongue.
Sounds that take me on a journey, to places from inside and outside</p>

<p>I will not get lost.</p>
